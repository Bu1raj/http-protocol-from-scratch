## Building HTTP protocol from scratch

This repo is my solution to this challenge - https://www.boot.dev/courses/learn-http-protocol-golang

I reffered this [video](https://youtu.be/FknTw9bJsXM?si=PXKfbFn2pukGjfno) by `ThePrimeagen` whenever I got stuck

There is lot of scope for refactoring the code

PS: did not vibe code it :), trust me...
